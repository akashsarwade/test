	CSRF stand for Cross site request forgery

 	Cross Origin Request Sharing

 	Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is a mechanism that allows web browsers 
 	to make cross-origin HTTP requests.It is used to control access to resources (e.g., APIs) hosted on different domains or origins. Here are a few reasons why CORS is used:
Security: Browsers enforce a security policy called the Same-Origin Policy (SOP), which restricts web pages from making requests to a different origin than the one they were loaded from. This policy is in place to protect users from malicious scripts running on websites. CORS provides a way to relax the SOP selectively, allowing controlled cross-origin access while still maintaining security.
API Integration: CORS is commonly used in web applications that need to integrate with APIs hosted on different domains. For example, if you have a frontend application hosted on example.com and you want to make API requests to api.example.com, the API server needs to enable CORS to allow the frontend application to access its resources.
Single-Page Applications (SPAs): SPAs built with frameworks like React, Angular, or Vue often use APIs from different domains for data retrieval. CORS enables these SPAs to make cross-origin requests and consume data from various sources.

Microservices Architecture: In a microservices architecture, different services may be hosted on separate domains. CORS allows these services to communicate with each other by specifying the allowed origins, methods, and headers for cross-origin requests.

Third-Party Integrations: If your web application integrates with third-party services or APIs, CORS is essential to enable communication between your application and the third-party domain.

It's important to note that CORS is enforced by web browsers, and the server hosting the resources must respond with appropriate CORS headers to allow or deny cross-origin requests. The headers define which origins are allowed to access the resources, which methods are allowed, and which headers can be included in the request.

By using CORS, developers can securely and selectively enable cross-origin access, facilitating seamless integration between web applications and APIs hosted on different domains.

 OAuth is a OpenAuthentication
 	and Authorization framework it allow one application to gain access users data within another application 
 	without user sharing his credentials
